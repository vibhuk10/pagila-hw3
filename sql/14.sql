 * Management also wants to create a "best sellers" list for each category.

 * For each category, reports the five films that have been rented the most for each category.
 *
 * Note that in the last query, we were ranking films by the total amount of payments made,
 * but in this query, you are ranking by the total number of times the movie has been rented (and ignoring the price).
